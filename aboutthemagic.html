    <h1>About Us</h1>
<p></p>
    <p>We’re a band of desert alchemists, turning sand into magic with 3D printers and laser engravers. Born from the endless dunes, we craft wands, totems, and oracles for those who dare to wield the extraordinary. Join our secret society of makers, dreamers, and manifestors.</p>
   <p></p>
    
    <h1> What do we do?</h1>
    <p>We dream, manifest, create, and develop the world around us even when the temperature and conditions are trying to kill us. We work through the constant desert setbacks, and we continue to move forward, to prove to ourselves we can do it and to teach others they can do it too. Magic surrounds Slab City and it truly is what you make of it, so bring your best most resilient self and come play, joke, and create with us.
